# üóû The Substrate Developer Newsletter

A place to facilitate content curation for the Substrate Developer Newsletter: a monthly digest for developers building with [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) with +2k subscribers and growing.

The Substrate Developer Newsletter aims to provide updates for developers in the Polkadot builder ecosystem including:

* **Community highlights**: SDKs, tooling or new products or updates from the community.
 
* **Upcoming events**: in-person or online events, such as Meetups or Hackathons.
 
* **Technical updates**: notable updates in the Substrate and Polkadot codebases.

* **Releases**: notes on new Polkadot releases and tooling maintained by Parity.

_As we move towards this more participatory contribution system, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/newsletter/issues) if you have any questions or feedback._

### ‚úÖ What do we look for when considering whether to include something in the Substrate Developer Newsletter?

* Community highlights including new pallets, SDKs, or libraries that could be interesting for other developers to learn about
* Upcoming events relevant to the Substrate and Polkadot developer community
* Learning material relevant to the Substrate and Polkadot developer community
* Developer blogs relevant to the Substrate and Polkadot developer community
* Mentions of PRs that are worthy of being included in the "Technical Updates" section

### ‚ùå What we are generally NOT looking for

* Promoting a particular project without any relevance for developers in the Polkadot ecosystem
* Promoting a specific job opening (we link out to a separate site for this anyways)
* Anything degrading to another community or existing community member
